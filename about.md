My name is Victor, I am 16 and I enjoy programming. I mostly write lower-level code or attempt reverse-engineering/patching of programs. Some of the more interesting projects of mine are [Xgui](https://github.com/Vik2015/Xgui), a C++ GUI library that depends only on Xlib and some extensions, [fdos][https://github.com/Vik2015/fdos], an attempt at an OS written in Assembly and [apple-dictionary][https://github.com/Vik2015/apple-dictionary], tools used for reading Apple Dictionaries, originally by `josephg`, that I've modified to get cleaner data.
